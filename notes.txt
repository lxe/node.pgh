getting up and running with Node.JS, Nodejitsu, and express.

+ install node and npm
+ signup for nodejitsu and try your account activates. I had some luck asking the devs on the #nodejitsu IRC channel
+ sudo npm install jitsu -g
+ jitsu users confirm <your-user-name> <your-confirmation-key>
+ build your site
+ jitsu deploy (walk through the setup prompts)
+ done!
